### As dropshippers we have to work with different type of online selling platforms. So we buy our items from one platform and resell it in other selling platform.So when we do a these type of thing we have to create a combination between those two platforms. For that we have so many solutions such like use a excel sheet and update it. But when we do that we were realized that it's not very user friendly. Therefore as a solution I have created a webpage and database to create a combination beteen those platforms. In this project there are three parts included. They are two web pages and one database. I have used two web pages, one for getting details and other one for show search details.
